Bifrost is a thumbnail generator for videos about Ragnarock, a VR rhythm game and soon-to-be-a-PC-game. You can easily create informative graphics about your scores and stats, without having to use an image editor.

# Features
Bifrost supports all image formats supported by the game. 
- Easy infographic creation
- Intuitive interface
- Custom backgrounds
- Chroma-key
- ALL map backgrounds (released up to April 2023) supported in one way or the other
- NEW: Click-to-edit function enables even easier editing for the main graphics
- Easy download with automatic naming
  - A feature to name it with "song-info" and "stats" at the end separately is in the progress.
- Well, that's pretty much it!

# Demonstration

The following two images show the output of the tool, which would be useful to be included inside videos, GIFs, etc.

# Limitations
- Since this is an online tool (though no data is saved or transmitted to online servers) you are required to have an internet connection.
  - This, however, can be rectified by downloading the site and accessing `bifrost` folder directly.
- A leaderboard position info screen was in the works, but it has been scrapped due to the complexity involved in editing the entries automatically or manually.
